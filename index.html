      <p>My name is Pete Rezanka. I am being re-introduced to coding. In high school I briefly coded on Basic and
        QBasic. But my real coding experience comes from TI-82 calculators. I was really good at making programs for
        Calculus, and even drawing multiple pictures (6 at most) to loop together in a video. I was such a dork but very
        proud of myself, and I made people laugh.</p>

      <p>As you can see from my portfolio page, I have a variety of interests. Each one is very important to me.
        Hopefully I am doing one of those things right now, unless I'm working on other interesting code, lol.</p>

      <p>Please feel free to drop me a line by accessing the Contacht link at the top of the page. I look forword to any
        feedback. Thanks!</p>
